# Currently supported images by Hetzner's rescue mode reside in /root/.oldroot/nfs/images/
# While only Debian Bookworm is tested, other Debian-based images like Ubuntu 22.04 "should" work.
# Beware that older distros use /etc/dropbear-initramfs path instead of /etc/dropbear/initramfs.
# In that case you have to adjust the paths inside the postinstall script.
